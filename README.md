What do jQuery selectors start with?

$ (I wasn't here last week so I'm not sure)

What's the problem with this code
in your html:
<div class="my-element">Hide me</div>
in your javascript:
$(".another-element").hide();

It needs to say "my-element"?

What's wrong with this code:
in your html:
<div class="my-element">Hide me</div>
in your javascript:
$("#hideMe").hide();

I have no idea. (Again, I wasn't here last week so I'm a bit behind)

If you have a FOLDER named lib and a FILE named app.js, why won't this link to your javascript work?
<script src="app.js"></script>

Because when you link you're linking to a folder, not a file?

What can you tell me about this: <input type="text"/> what is it? what will we be using them for?

No, I cannot tell you about that. I have no idea.
